##### Now some boring stuff:

Tacalyâ€™s trademarks and brands are Tacaly intellectual property and are important and valuable assets of the corporation. Trademarks must be used properly. Follow these guidelines for using Tacalyâ€™s trademarks and brands properly in all communications, documents, and electronic messages. Use the appropriate trademark symbol and trademark acknowledgment of Tacalyâ€™s ownership of the marks and/or logos in question. Do not incorporate Tacaly trademarks or logos into your own product names, service names, trademarks, logos, or company names, and do not adopt marks or logos that are confusingly similar to Tacalyâ€™s marks and logos. Do not make unlicensed use of Tacalyâ€™s licensed logos, such as the TacalyÂ® logo. Third-party use of Tacaly logos requires a license or written permission from Tacaly. If you are interested in obtaining a license to use an Tacaly mark or logo, contact your Tacaly marketing or sales representative, or your local Tacaly sales office. If you are a LICENSEE of an Tacaly trademark or logo, your license agreement that you signed with Tacaly may have special trademark and logo usage guidelines different than the Guidelines set forth here. If so, please follow the special guidelines provided to you pursuant to your license agreement. ref: https://tacaly.com
